This article introduces a change of ID to UUID. Specifically, to prevent the security flaw that a sequential ID provides. 
In this case, the problem is known a security fault from which from an ID it is possible to discover the following sequences. 
The solution presented is applied directly to PostgreSQL, replacing the IDs with UUIDs. 
The goal is to improve the security of existing databases.
